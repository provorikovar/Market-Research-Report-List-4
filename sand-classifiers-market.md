<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sand Classifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>120~180</li><li>180~210</li><li>210~300</li><li>300~420</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sand classifiers are equipment used in the process of separating different-sized particles in sand. There are four main types based on the range of particle sizes they can separate: 120~180, 180~210, 210~300, and 300~420. The 120~180 classifier separates particles between 120 and 180 microns, the 180~210 classifier between 180 and 210 microns, the 210~300 classifier between 210 and 300 microns, and the 300~420 classifier between 300 and 420 microns. Each type is designed to efficiently separate particles within its specified range.</p></p>
