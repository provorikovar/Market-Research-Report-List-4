<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent</li><li>Semi-permanent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal release agents are used in various industries to prevent materials from sticking to metal surfaces during the manufacturing process. Two common types of metal release agents are permanent and semi-permanent. Permanent release agents form a lasting barrier between the metal surface and the material being molded, providing long-term protection. In contrast, semi-permanent release agents provide temporary protection and can be reapplied as needed. Both types of release agents play a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient manufacturing processes in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and construction.</p></p>
