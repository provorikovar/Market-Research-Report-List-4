<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Particle Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proton Therapy</li><li>Heavy Ion Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Particle therapy is a type of cancer treatment that involves using high-energy beams to target and destroy cancer cells. There are two main types of particle therapy: proton therapy and heavy ion therapy. Proton therapy uses protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Heavy ion therapy, on the other hand, uses heavier particles such as carbon ions to penetrate deeper into tumors, making it especially effective for treating larger and more aggressive cancers. Both types of particle therapy offer precise and effective treatment options for cancer patients.</p></p>
