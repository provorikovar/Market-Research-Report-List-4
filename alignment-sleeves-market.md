<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alignment Sleeves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split Sleeves</li><li>Solid Sleeves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alignment sleeves are an essential component in fiber optic systems and are primarily used in splicing and connecting optical fibers. The two main types of alignment sleeves are split sleeves and solid sleeves. Split sleeves feature two halves that come together to hold the fibers in place, allowing for easier fiber insertion. Solid sleeves, on the other hand, are one-piece sleeves that provide more stability and durability. Both types of sleeves play a crucial role in maintaining proper alignment and connection of optical fibers in fiber optic systems.</p></p>
