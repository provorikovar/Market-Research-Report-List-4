<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Air-conditioning Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Compression Refrigeration</li><li>Absorption Refrigeration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central air-conditioning systems utilize different technologies for cooling. The most common type is vapor compression refrigeration, which involves a compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator to remove heat from indoor air. On the other hand, absorption refrigeration uses a heat source to drive a refrigeration cycle, making it more energy-efficient but less common. Both types of systems are used in commercial and residential buildings, with vapor compression being more widely used due to its lower cost and higher efficiency.</p></p>
