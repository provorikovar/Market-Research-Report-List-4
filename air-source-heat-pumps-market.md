<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Source Heat Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-to-Air</li><li>Air-to-Water</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air Source Heat Pumps come in two main types: Air-to-Air and Air-to-Water. Air-to-Air heat pumps transfer heat from the outside air to the inside of a building through a fan system, providing heating and cooling directly to the indoor space. On the other hand, Air-to-Water heat pumps transfer heat from the outside air to a water storage tank, which can then be used to heat water for domestic use or to provide underfloor heating in the building. Both types offer efficient and environmentally friendly heating solutions.</p></p>
