<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure Ventilation</li><li>Negative-pressure Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation Market Types include Positive-pressure Ventilation and Negative-pressure Ventilation. Positive-pressure Ventilation involves delivering air or oxygen into the lungs through a mask or nasal prongs, helping to keep the airways open and improve breathing. Negative-pressure Ventilation, on the other hand, creates negative pressure around the chest to assist with breathing by drawing air into the lungs. Both types of ventilation offer noninvasive methods of providing respiratory support to patients without the need for invasive procedures.</p></p>
