<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Liquid Flow Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inline Type</li><li>Clamp-On Type</li><li>Insertion Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic liquid flow meters are available in three main types - Inline, Clamp-On, and Insertion. Inline type meters are installed directly in the pipeline, providing accurate flow measurement without disrupting the flow. Clamp-On meters are attached externally to the pipe, making installation quick and non-intrusive. Insertion type meters are inserted into the pipe through a small hole, ideal for larger pipes where inline installation is not feasible. Each type offers its own advantages and is suitable for different applications.</p></p>
