<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Spectrophotometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam Type</li><li>Double Beam Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable spectrophotometers come in two main types: Single Beam Type and Double Beam Type. Single Beam Type spectrophotometers use a single beam of light to measure the absorbance of a sample, making them simpler and less expensive. On the other hand, Double Beam Type spectrophotometers split the light beam into two separate beams, one passing through the sample and the other through a reference solution. This design offers improved accuracy and stability, making them ideal for more precise measurements in research and quality control applications.</p></p>
