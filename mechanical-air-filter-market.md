<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Air Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Filters</li><li>Sub-HEPA Filters</li><li>Secondary Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical air filter market includes various types such as pre-filters, sub-HEPA filters, and secondary filters. Pre-filters are designed to capture large particles before they reach the main filter, prolonging its lifespan. Sub-HEPA filters provide higher filtration efficiency than pre-filters but are not as efficient as HEPA filters. Secondary filters work to further eliminate smaller particles that may have passed through the primary filters. Each type serves a specific function in maintaining clean air quality in various environments.</p></p>
