<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Base Isolation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NRB</li><li>LRB</li><li>HDR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seismic base isolation systems are designed to protect buildings and infrastructure from earthquake damage by absorbing and dissipating seismic energy. There are three main types of seismic base isolation systems: Natural Rubber Bearings (NRB), Lead Rubber Bearings (LRB), and High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDR). </p><p>NRB systems use natural rubber to provide flexibility and energy dissipation, while LRB systems utilize lead cores to enhance damping performance. HDR systems, on the other hand, employ a combination of rubber and metal to achieve high damping capabilities. Each of these systems offers unique advantages in mitigating seismic forces and protecting structures.</p></p>
