<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Real-time Mocap System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical System</li><li>Non-optical System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Real-time mocap systems are divided into two main types: optical systems and non-optical systems. Optical mocap systems use cameras to track markers attached to an actor's body, offering high precision and accuracy, but they can be expensive and require a controlled environment. Non-optical mocap systems, on the other hand, utilize sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes to capture motion data without the need for markers or cameras. While non-optical systems are more affordable and portable, they may not provide the same level of accuracy as optical systems.</p></p>
